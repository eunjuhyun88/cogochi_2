# PLANS

Purpose:
- Canonical entry point for execution plans.
- Distinguishes active work, completed work, and ongoing debt.

## Planning Rules

1. Small one-shot changes may live in a dated design doc.
2. Multi-step work should be represented in `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
3. Completed plans move to `docs/exec-plans/completed/` or are marked historical from the index.
4. The watch log records execution history; it is not the canonical plan.

## Current Active Planning Surface

- `docs/exec-plans/index.md`
- `docs/exec-plans/active/context-system-rollout-2026-03-06.md`
- `docs/FRONTEND_REFACTOR_EXECUTION_DESIGN_2026-03-06.md`
- `docs/terminal-refactor-master-plan-2026-03-06.md`

## Current Debt Tracking Surface

- `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
- `docs/REFACTORING_BACKLOG.md`
- `docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md`

## Planning Discipline

- Plans should state scope, invariants, steps, and exit criteria.
- A plan should point to canonical design docs instead of copying them.
- If a dated design doc becomes the de facto authority, promote its stable parts into canonical docs.

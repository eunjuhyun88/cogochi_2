# STOCKCLAW Docs Context Map

Purpose:
- `README.md` is the collaboration and execution SSOT.
- This file is the task-level document router.
- Read this file before opening multiple specs, audits, or old plans.

## Fast Start

1. `README.md`
   - Workflow, branch policy, validation gates, context automation.
2. `AGENTS.md`
   - Mandatory agent execution rules.
3. `docs/SYSTEM_INTENT.md`
   - Product thesis and invariants.
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Root map for domains and canonical docs.
5. `docs/README.md` (this file)
   - Choose the smallest relevant doc set for the task.
6. Relevant design/spec docs
   - Usually 2 to 4 files before reading code.

## Active Boundaries

- Active implementation target: the current git worktree rooted at this repository
- Canonical code lives in: `src/`, `db/`, `supabase/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`
- Sibling clone folders outside this repo are reference-only unless a current plan explicitly says otherwise.
- `docs/archive/` is historical context, not current authority.
- `docs/AGENT_WATCH_LOG.md` is an operations log, not a design spec. Read targeted entries only.
- `.agent-context/` is runtime memory, not a source of authority.

## Structured Knowledge Base

- `docs/design-docs/`
  - stable design beliefs and design-catalog index
- `docs/product-specs/`
  - short surface specs for Terminal, Arena, Signals, Passport
- `docs/exec-plans/`
  - active plans, completed plans, debt tracker
- `docs/generated/`
  - derived navigation artifacts
- `docs/references/`
  - high-signal references and scripts

| API / data / providers | `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/generated/db-schema.md`, `docs/database-design.md`, `docs/BACKEND_SECURITY_REVIEW_2026-02-25.md` | Contract first, then data/security constraints. |
| Routes / stores / API surface inventory | `docs/generated/route-map.md`, `docs/generated/store-authority-map.md`, `docs/generated/api-group-map.md` | Fast repo-local inventory for navigation and authority checks. |

## Context Budget Rules

- Do not bulk-read every file in `docs/`.
- Do not skip the canonical entry docs and jump straight into dated working docs.
- Do not treat old audits as source of truth when a newer execution design exists.
- Do not start in `docs/archive/` unless the active doc explicitly points there.
- Do not scan the full watch log; use keyword/date filtering when you need recent decisions.
- When a task changes ongoing behavior or architecture, update the canonical doc for that surface, not just the watch log.

## Promotion Rules

- Put stable execution rules in `AGENTS.md` or `README.md`.
- Put root architecture routing in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Put task routing and doc authority changes in `docs/README.md`.
- Put stable surface intent in `docs/product-specs/*.md`.
- Put current implementation plans in dated execution design docs or `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
- Move superseded plans/specs into `docs/archive/` once they are no longer current.

## Known Gaps

- Some deep Arena/War edge cases still live in the upstream unified design outside the git root.
- Several deep implementation docs are still dated working plans rather than promoted canonical specs.
- Multiple sibling clones still exist, which increases drift risk even when `frontend` is treated as canonical.

The next documentation step should be consolidating the most frequently used external design rules into repo-local docs so future agent runs do not depend on parent-folder context.
